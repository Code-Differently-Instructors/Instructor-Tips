# Skribbl.io

Skribbl.io is a free multiplayer drawing and guessing game. 

Users have the option to play by randomly being placed in a room with others or create private rooms.

Private rooms are most ideal in work/learning settings. There is more control. Private rooms offer certain options such as:

- custom words: incorporate keywords from courses
- custom drawing times

Private rooms only allow **12** people at a time. Be mindful of that.
