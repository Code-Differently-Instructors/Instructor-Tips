# Payroll & Timesheets

This document serves as a reference to the payroll process for New Castle County Youth employees.

All timesheets are to be submitted each week by the end of day **Friday, 5:00PM**.

A pay week for New Castle County is from **Monday** to **Sunday**. 


## Timesheets and Folder Creation

We use Google Drive, currently, to share, track, and submit timesheets from each employee. Here are a few steps that will need to be completed prior to the first day of work. 
Steps are as followed:

1. Create a folder in Google Drive to hold all of the timesheets. Be sure to give the folder an appropriate title. "Payroll" works.

2. Create folders per cohort. Use the cohort's name as the folder title.

3. In each of the cohort's folder, create folders for each individual employee using their name as the title.

4. [Click here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CJ2xZOJr8QaVHgHaJXbMEyyZOF1EH0y3V3VqSue1SWA/edit?usp=sharing) to find a blank copy of the timesheet. Prior to adding this sheet to each employee's folder, do the following:
    - Enter the date range for the first week of the cohort 
    - Update the dates for the days of the week 
    - Update the dates for "week starting" and "week ending"
    - Add your signature to the  timesheet
        1. Click `Insert`
        2. Select `Drawing`, small window will appear
        3. Click the dropdown arrow next to the `Line` icon
        4. Select `Scribble`
        5. Use your trackpad or mouse to create a signature
        6. Click `Save and Close`
        7. Drag and drop the signature in the appropriate area and resize

    > The spreadsheet includes 1 other spreadsheet, which is an example of how to fill it out. 

5. Make a copy and place in each employee's folder. Do not worry about the text "Copy of" in the title. This will be replaced with their name during orientation. 

6. Share the Google folder with the corresponding employee using their email address. Employees will need "`Editor`" permissions. 

    - Roger Campbell and all other instructors involved in he dev shop need to have "`Editor`" permissions as well.


## Payroll Orientation

The first day of the program will be orientation. During the payroll portion, share screen and walk employees through the process for completing a weekly timesheet.

They will need to do the following:

1. Replace the text "Copy of" with their name in the title of the spreadsheet.

2. Add their name to the cell "Employee Name:".

3. Update the title of the first tab with their name.

4. If their hours of the first week are not populated, show them how to enter values.

    - Values must be entered in the 12 hour format. If values are not entered correctly, they may appear in the 24 hour format. 
    - Click [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WIbnVQN6R8EPRQuVmEaVUG_bKymqMm-BItX3p66SQkw/edit?usp=sharing). This document can serve as a reference for the employees if they forget how to complete a timesheet. Share it with them.
    This includes:
        - Instructions for creating a new timesheet
        - How to add a signature
        - How to fix the time format
5. Add their signature to the timesheet. 

Values must be entered in an increment of 15 minutes. Round up or down if an employee starts their shift later than they scheduled time or leave before the end of their shift. 

## Timesheet Collection

At the end of each cohort's work week, employees will need to submit their timesheets to the supervisor for approval. To collect their timesheet we use a Google Form that can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1oHtVJAHPsNqUJmT8CH3mPC1hFporelA4H6hNp28Kuks/edit). 
Each employee will add their name, cohort's name, and a link directly to the timesheet of that week. 

The spreadsheet that collects the responses can be cleared after the week's timesheets have been submitted to the county. 

>You can also access their timesheets from their Google folders.

## Steps Prior to County Submission

1. Create a folder in the "Payroll" folder and name it "Submitted Timesheets". This will hold all of workbooks created weekly to submit to the county.

2. Create a new Spreadsheet and title it "Code Differently DevShop Week `[Enter Week Range]`.

3. Refer back to the Timesheet Submission form spreadsheet and click the first submitted timesheet. This should open the employee's timesheet for viewing. 

4. Review their timesheet for accuracy. Their values should reflect any time missed during the work week.

5. Right click the tab with their name.

6. Select `Copy to`, then click `Existing Spreadsheet`. Select the spreadsheet that will be submitted to the county for that week.

7. Continue to add all of the timesheets until complete. It is fine to leave the text "Copy of" on the tabs. 

8. Ensure each employee has been accounted for and is included in the workbook.

## Timesheet Submission to County

1. Compose an email to Stacey Key-Davis of the New Castle County office. She is the case manager for the program. Her email is stacey.key-davis@newcastlede.gov. Include Roger Campbell in the email as well. No elaborate email is needed. A short sentence stating what is attached will suffice. 
    > In the event an employee misses an entire week of work, state that in the email as well as the reason. 
    
2. Give Stacey `View` permissions to the week's timesheet workbook.

## Timesheet Submission to School Coordinator

Some of our partnered schools may ask for a copy of an employee's timesheet each week. Student participating in the school's co-op program, receive grades based on their participation in the program. 
In a separate email, attach the employee's timesheet and give `View` permission to that person. Include Roger in the email as well.

**For this year 2020-2021, there is a special note at the bottom of this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ob5h834OB1RsUO_nzZR3AcToIz3ganP9kMDzpDd1KbY/edit).** Please read and follow the instructions. 


## Notes

- Payroll is due on Fridays by the end of the day. 

- Stacey is the point of contact for all things related to the employee's pay and paperwork. Any questions regarding direct deposit, pay stubs, or wages, need to go to her. Always include Roger in emails to her. 
    - Email address: stacey.key-davis@newcastlede.gov
    - Phone number: 302-383-1937

- Reminders have been set for each current cohort in Slack. [Boolean Autocrats, Cinnamon Code Crunchers, and Digital Tulips]. The reminders include a link to the Google form for timesheet submission. 

- Good practice to view a cohort's timesheets the prior to the end of the work day to ensure any corrections can be made by them. This will avoid the amount of corrections you have to make. 30 minutes prior to the end of the shift on the last day of their work week will suffice.
