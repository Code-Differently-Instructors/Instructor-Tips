# Dev Shop Sprint Retrospective Meeting

A sprint retrospective is a great way for your team to reflect on the previous sprint, the work that was done, the goals achieved, and generate ideas for improvement. The trick is to change up the format every once in a while – retros quickly become stale if you sleepwalk your way through the same agenda every time. Below you will see an example of a sprint retrospective on trello:

## What is covered in a retrospective? (Per Scrum.org)
During the Sprint Retrospective, the team discusses:

- What went well in the Sprint
- What could be improved
- What needs to be changed
- What will we commit to improve in the next Sprint

The Scrum Master encourages the Scrum Team to improve its development process and practices to make it more effective and enjoyable for the next Sprint. During each Sprint Retrospective, the Scrum Team plans ways to increase product quality by improving work processes or adapting the definition of “Done” if appropriate and not in conflict with product or organizational standards.


## After Retrospective
By the end of the Sprint Retrospective, the Scrum Team should have identified improvements that it will implement in the next Sprint. Implementing these improvements in the next Sprint is the adaptation to the inspection of the Scrum Team itself. Although improvements may be implemented at any time, the Sprint Retrospective provides a formal opportunity to focus on inspection and adaptation.
