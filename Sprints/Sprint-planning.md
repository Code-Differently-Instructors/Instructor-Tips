# Dev Shop Sprint Planning Meeting

Sprint planning meeting should be held on the first day of each sprint and should be no more than 30 minutes. 

Use [Trello](https://trello.com/) to create a Kanban board and invite each member of the team. 

1. Decide the length of a Sprint.

    - 1 week or 2 weeks

2. Establish the goals for the sprint.

    - What modules are the student/employees supposed to have completed?

    - How many badges should a student/employee at the end of the sprint?

    - What labs/projects are to be completed in a sprint?

    - What user stories align with the established goals?

    - What user stories can be completed in a sprint?

    - The team will need to discuss what can be completed in a sprint.

3. Create a sprint backlog of the tasks to be completed during the sprint. Add time estimates to each task. 

    - Modules to be completed

    - Badges to be earned

    - Labs

    - Projects

    - User Stories to be completed

    > Task need to encompass each part of the definition of "done".
    > Ex: To mark a module "done", all videos, code challenges, and quizzes must be completed to earn a badge. 

4. Double-check with dev team that tasks can be completed in a sprint
