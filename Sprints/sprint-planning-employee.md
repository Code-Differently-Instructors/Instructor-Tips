# Dev Shop Sprint Planning Meeting

Sprint planning meeting should be held on the first day of each sprint.

Use [Trello](https://trello.com/) to create a board from our template to begin your sprint planning. 

Sprint Length: 


1. Establish the goals for the sprint.

    - What modules to have completed?

    - What labs/projects are to be completed in a sprint?

    - What user stories align with the established goals?

    - What user stories can be completed in a sprint?


2. Create a sprint backlog of the tasks to be completed during the sprint. Add time estimates to each task. 

    - Modules to be completed

    - Labs

    - Projects

    - User Stories to be completed

    > Each task needs to encompass each part of the definition of "done".

    > Example: To mark a module "done", all videos, code challenges, and quizzes must be completed to earn a badge. 

3. Each day, move cards from the Backlog to their appropriate category.
