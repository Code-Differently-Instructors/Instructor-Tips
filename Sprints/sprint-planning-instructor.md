# Dev Shop Sprint Planning 

This is a guide of how the dev shop employees should approach sprint planning, whether individually or in a group. 

A template of the Trello board is [here](https://trello.com/b/rkGHsOBW/devshop-sprint-planning-template#). Employees can create a copy of the template to create their own boards.

- Decide the length of a Sprint.
    - This is the task of the instructors
    - 1 week or 2 weeks
    

- Establish the goals for the sprint.

    Instructors need to decide what is to be completed by the employees in a sprint. Below are some things to think about.

    - What modules are the student/employees supposed to have completed?

    - What labs/projects are to be completed in a sprint?

    - What user stories align with the established goals? (Advance project management)

    - What user stories can be completed in a sprint? (Advance project management)


- Create a sprint backlog of the tasks to be completed during the sprint. 

    Trello board template has archived cards of each course and their modules for employees to check off during the sprint. They are located in the "Backlog" board.

    - Modules to be completed

    - Labs

    - Projects

    - User Stories to be completed 

    > **Explain to the employees**: To mark a module "done", all videos, code challenges, and quizzes must be completed to earn a badge. 

Sprint Planning reviews can be held with employees if needed.

It is expected that each employee uses their Trello board everyday for project management.
