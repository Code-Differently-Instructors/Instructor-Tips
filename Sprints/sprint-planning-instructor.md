# Dev Shop Sprint Planning 

This is a guide of how the dev shop employees should approach sprint planning, whether individually or in a group. 

A template of the Trello board is [here](https://trello.com/b/rkGHsOBW/devshop-sprint-planning-template#). Employees can create a copy of the template to create their own boards.

- A sprint is time-boxed for 2 weeks
    

- Establish the goals for the sprint.

    Instructors need to decide what is to be completed by the employees in a sprint. Below are some things to think about.

    - What modules are the student/employees supposed to have completed?

    - What labs/projects are to be completed in a sprint?

    - What user stories align with the established goals? (Advanced project management)

    - What user stories can be completed in a sprint? (Advanced project management)

    - Create a product backlog of tasks to be completed by student/employees for a sprint


- Create a sprint backlog of the tasks to be completed during the sprint.

    - Instructors, based of the product backlog will give guidelines for the sprint backlog to students/employees.

    - Student/employees will add the appropriate tasks to their sprint backlogs.

    Trello board template has archived cards of each course and their modules for student/employees to check off during the sprint. They are located in the "Backlog" board.

    - Modules to be completed

    - Labs

    - Projects

    - User Stories to be completed 

    > **Explain to the employees**: To mark a module "done", all videos, code challenges, and quizzes must be completed to earn a badge. 

Sprint Planning reviews can be held with students/employees if needed.

It is expected that each student/employee uses their Trello board everyday for project management.

Each student/employee will need to submit the URL of their Trello board for the supervisors. Use the Google Form located [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1r0q6vM4o2C1A1vxa0C-SUGd6J3RG1t6RKHNNjYN-I3Q/edit) to capture their URLs. Use this [link](https://forms.gle/eeTTMyhjZKCHwTgeA) to give to the students/employees.
